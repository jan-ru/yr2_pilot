    "text": "1.0.1 Alliander\nWhen discussing possible candidates where a pilot case study can be performed we discusses it might be useful to focus on semi-public organisations such as utility companies or indeed housing cooperations.\nOne such utility company is Alliander, it develops and operates energy networks. I received from Stijn the contact details of Pallas Agterberg and Perry Nouwens at Alliander. I have contacted Pallas1. From my own network I contacted Tiemen van der Tuin, who works with Alliander as a contractor. Pallas checked in the organisation if interviews would be possible but that was not the case due to the organisation having other priorities2.",

    "text": "1.2 Previous version: Mini Case Study - Status 28/11/2023\nSince the call on 18/10/2023 I have identified 3 prospects where potentially an initial mini case study can be performed with respect to:\nRQ-1: What are approaches for aligning business processes with regulatory requirements to achieve regulatory compliance by design?\nMedTech Startup\nPraxasense is a startup developing a heart-rhythm monitorig device. The company is a spin-off of the TU Delft. It was founded in 2019 and it employees 10 people.\nContact: Leonard Moonen (CEO)\nAddress: Molengraaffsingel 12, 2629 JD Delft (NL).\nAdvantage: the company is small and I would have full access to the team preparing for certification (ISO 13485). ISO 13485 is a norm based on ISO9001 that all companies producing medical equipment need to be compliant with.\nDisadvantage: the company is an R&D company that is presently not regulated yet as there are no commercial activities.\nFinancial Institution\nRabobank is one of three large banks in the Netherlands. Rabobank exists since 1972. It employs 43 thousand people.\nContact: Eiso Bos (Global Head Financial Economic Crime Governance, Risk & Change)\nAddress: Croeselaan 18, 3521 CB Utrecht (NL)\nAdvantage: the Rabobank is a well known name (in NL). Performing a mini case study well may lead to doing case studies with other financial institutions.\nDisadvantage: I may have limited access to my contact. Also the main processes (of interest to the bank) are likely about KYC (know your customer) and AML (anti money laundering).\nHousing Association\nLaurentius is a housing association bases in Breda. They rent and maintain some 8.300 real estate objects.\nPossible contact: Paul van Roosmalen (CEO)\nAdvantage: Two advantages are 1) an advanced data exchange with the government and 2) a possible link with CO2 emissions. Housing Associations are highly regulated in the Netherlands. In September 2022 a covenant has been signed relating to further improve the information exchange with the government (system-to-system) based on SBR (XBRL).\nDisadvantage: I have not yet been in contact with a Laurentius, so no visibility about the timeline yet.\nNote: if other cases are situated in the same (housing) sector, further contact is AEDES (vereniging van woningcooperaties).\nConcluding remarks\nShort term most progress can likely be made in a smaller (less complex) organisation?\nLonger term the housing association sector can provide for interesting case studies. The information exchange with the government entails more than actual financial data. Next to actual financial data also planning data is exchanged. A sector wide taxonomy has been defined (information model) that facilitates inter-organisation business processes.",
