RQ: What are approaches for aligning business processes with regulatory requirements to achieve regulatory compliance by design?

On 7/11/2023 we discussed I would perform a test: searching the databases with the initial set of search terms mentioned below.

## Search terms (Q1-Q5)

1) "business process management" and "regulatory compliance"
2) "business process management" and "regulatory compliance" and "systematic literature review"
3) "business process management" and "compliance risk management"
4) "business process management" and "regulatory risk management"
5) "managing regulatory compliance in business processes"

Synonyms used: "BPM" for "Business Process Management"

## Resources to be searched (R1-R6)

A) Web of Science [Clarivate](https://www-webofscience-com)
B) ScienceDirect [Elsevier](https://www-sciencedirect-com)
C) SSNR [Elsevier](https://www.ssrn.com/)
D) arXiv > [cs](https://arxiv.org/search/cs)
E) dblp, computer science bibliography [dblp](https://dblp.org/)
F) zenodo, OpenAIRE repository [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/)

A more description of these databases is included as an appendix. (describe limitations)

Change per 22-11-2023: excluded Scopus, included Zenodo.
Change per 01-12-2023: include openAlex

```

## Conclusion about search terms

Both "Reglatory Risk Management" and "Compliance Risk Management" did seem valid concepts from an earlier (2021) google scholar search. However, combining these terms with "Business Process Management" or "BPM" yields only (very) few results.

**Proposed exclusion / inclusion criteria**

- Exclude medical
- Exclude IoT
- Exclude blockchain
- Include Risk Management
- Include Workflow Management Systems

## Conclusion about sources

Provided that SSRN yields a total of 0 results on every query (excluding additional query 6) this datasource will not be used for the SLR.

Provided that ArXiv yields a total of 1 results (excluding additional query 6) this database will not be used for the SLR either. 

The searches have also been performed on the SocArXiv repository. Here too 0 results.

## Definitions

Two seemingly related concepts are BPM (Business Process Management) and WMS (Workflow Management System). The Workflow Management Coalition [(WfMC)](https://wfmc.org/what-is-bpm/) presents definitions of both concepts:

"**Business process management** (BPM) is a discipline involving any combination of modeling, automation, execution, control, measurement and optimization of business activity flows, in support of enterprise goals, spanning systems, employees, customers and partners within and beyond the enterprise boundaries.”

"**Workflow management system** (WMS) is a software application that is designed to help organizations automate and manage their business processes. A WMS allows an organization to define and implement a workflow – a series of tasks, steps, and decisions – that need to be followed to complete a specific process. The system can then be used to track the progress of the workflow, manage the flow of information and documents, and ensure that tasks are completed in the correct order and by the right people.""
