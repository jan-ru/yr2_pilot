[Conformance](https://thecontentauthority.com/blog/conformance-vs-compliance)

Conformance refers to the act of adhering to a set of standards or requirements. It involves ensuring that a product, service, or system meets the specified expectations and performs as intended. Conformance can be viewed as a proactive approach to quality management, where the focus is on preventing defects and errors from occurring in the first place.

Conformance often involves the use of quality management systems, such as ISO 9001, which provide a framework for organizations to establish and maintain a culture of quality. These systems typically involve a set of procedures and processes that are designed to ensure that products and services consistently meet customer requirements and comply with relevant regulations.
